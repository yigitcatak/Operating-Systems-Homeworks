- Homework 1: Creating a C program to simulate a piped shell command
- Homework 2: Creating a C program to simulate shell. It takes input command.txt and executes each command one by one. The shell program takes care of input and output redirecting. Commands are executed concurrently depending on whether they are background processes or not. The outputs of the concurent programs are handled by a printer thread so that they are not intertwined.
